After a long time, I finally managed to create a gallery page.

<!--more-->

# New page

I feel I should make more content for my own website, and one aspect of it is a gallery page. Right now it is divided into 2 categories, graphic design and UI design.

# A window for better websites

For image hosting, I go with Imagekit, because it has a great free plan to start and natively support in Nuxt Image v1. Combined with Spotlight.js, the images load quick and can be enlarge.

With all of these works done, I feel confident to build a gallery website for other people without worrying about speed.
