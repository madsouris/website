I've been working on the version 2.0 of the Workout Checklist app for the past two months, and it's finally here. The core concept remains the sameâ€”the app tells me what to do in each workout session. Here are the new features and improvements:

<!--more-->

# Better UI

I moved from a blue color to red, especially when the stopwatch is running. The goal is to make things intense and make me feel like it's burning. I still kept light and dark mode and it still responds to the device's theme mode.

# Better stopwatch

Stopwatch and its buttons have been improved as well. When tapping on the stop button, it pauses the stopwatch and gives a useful confirmation screen. Now, we can tell if we're working out or pausing thanks to the bright theme color. I also moved the stopwatch to Pinia's store.

# Added Core Workouts

Welcome to the new core workouts; now you can improve your core and abs without any equipment.

# New Icon

The app icon is less lame than before.

# Updated all dependencies

All the technology stacks have been updated to the latest version.

# Future plan

I'd like to move to Firebase so I can store data and workout history. There's still a lot to learn and many improvements to be implemented.
