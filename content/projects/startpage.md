Inspired by the folks from r/startpage and r/unixporn I decided to make this project. I really help me to open link faster when I launch my web browser.

# Features

![startpage website](/img/startpage.png)

-   Shortcut keys to go to each link faster without clicking
-   Google search
-   Responsive
-   Progressive web app, it’s very fast

# Development

I’m genuinely amazed by the speed of Vitejs, launching a dev server is very fast, and creating a project is also very easy, so I use it.

You probably know about utility class frameworks like Tailwind, I’m really into it. But I discover Windi and UnoCSS, UnoCSS is more like an experimental project to push the speed of front-end templating to the next level. I decided to use UnoCSS solely because I can use the custom value on the fly, and out of the box experience is complete for what I need.
