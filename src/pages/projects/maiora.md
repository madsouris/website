Maiora Ventures, an innovative tech investment firm, approached me to redefine their brand identity and create a compelling online presence. My task was to deliver a modern logo design and a dynamic one-page website that would showcase their impressive investment portfolio and attract potential partners. The project combined creativity and functionality, focusing on building a design that resonates with Maiora’s mission to revolutionize markets.

# Logo Design

The logo for Maiora Ventures reflects their vision of greatness and innovation. Using a sleek, typographic approach, I designed a wordmark that subtly emphasizes the letters “a” and “i,” symbolizing artificial intelligence and advancement. The result is a bold yet sophisticated logo that embodies their tech-driven ethos.

# Web Design

For their one-page website, I utilized Elementor on WordPress to craft a seamless, responsive design. The site highlights Maiora Ventures’ investments with a clean, modern layout, ensuring an intuitive user experience. Key features include:

- A hero section with impactful visuals and clear messaging.
- A dedicated portfolio area showcasing high-profile investments.
- Optimized responsiveness for mobile and desktop, ensuring accessibility on all devices.
