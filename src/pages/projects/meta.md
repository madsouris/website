Meta was an app prototype for donations. Users can donate to various charities using multiple payment solutions and collect the badges.

Meta is a Khmer word, that translates to “Mercy”.

# Design

![Meta app](https://ik.imagekit.io/madsouris/vannrith/projects/meta.png?tr=1200)

I designed Meta using pastel-styled colors and made it simple as I can. The app is exclusively available on mobile phones, so the navigation, transitions, etc were made with mobile in mind. To keep it simple and controlled, I specifically disabled dark mode, so everyone will receive the same experience.

# Development

The app was pushed as a challenge at our local event, so we had like a week to complete it. After I finished the design in Figma, I started building the template using Xamarin and my friend can start binding data and other integrations using the Dotnet framework.

The app was running great when testing, unfortunately, we didn’t win anything.
